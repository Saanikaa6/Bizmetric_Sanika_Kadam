### **Project - I : Restaurant Bill Generator**
 This is a Python project built using Python and SQL, where I've connected Python to a SQL Server database using pyodbc.The project includes Object Oriented Programming(OOP) concepts.
 
 Functionality :
 1. Firstly it connects to a SQL Server Database.
 2. Displays the menu items from the database. 
 3. Allows the users to choose the items with quantities.
 4. Stores each order details in the database.
 5. Calculates the total amount. 
 6. Generates the bill.

I got to learn database connectivity from this, I also practised more on SQL queries in python.

### **Project - II : E-commerce System**
This is a Python project developed using OOP concepts. It is a basic E-commerce system where users can view products, select items by entering the product ID, add them to a cart, and generate the final bill. It helped me understand how classes and objects work in real-life scenarios.

Functionality :

1. Displays available products with ID, price, and stock.
2. Allows the user to select products using Product ID.
3. Validates product ID using exception handling.
4. Checks stock availability before adding items to the cart.
5. Allows multiple product purchases.
6. Calculates the total amount and applies a 10% discount on orders above ₹50,000.
7. Calculates total of all products and completes the order process.

From this project, I improved my understanding of OOP concepts like classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, etc..
I also practiced input validation, exception handling and logic implementation in Python.
